<H2>Ingredients</H2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>5 ½ cup flour</li>
    <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
   <li> Combine the milk, 1 cup of water, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil then remove from the heat and let stand until lukewarm. If the mixture is too hot, it will kill the yeast.
   </li>
    <li>In a large bowl, stir together the flour and yeast. Pour in wet ingredients and stir until the dough starts to pull together. If you have a stand mixer, use the dough hook to mix for about 8 minutes. If not, knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover and let stand until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
    </li>
   <li> Punch down the dough and divide into 12 portions They should be a little larger than a golf ball. Make tight balls out of the dough by pulling the dough tightly around and pinching it at the bottom. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil. After the rolls sit for a minute and relax, flatten each ball with the palm of your hand until it is 3 to 4 inches wide. You may want to oil your hand first. Set rolls aside until they double in size, about 20 minutes.
